## **A case study** 
*Mitigating effects of the 6 February earthquake.*

## **Aim and Objectives**
- Aim
  * Detection of collapsed buildings whose rubble must be removed and heavily damaged buildings that must be detonated in a controlled manner.
  
- Objectives
  * Detection of the regions affected by the 6 Fabruary Turkey earthquake using satellite images and ground surveys.
  * Visualizing the data of the buildings damaged in the 6 Fabruary Turkey earthquake, enabling them to be identified more easily.
  * Facilitating the removal of the rubble by determining the locations of the collapsed buildings.
  * Facilitating the determination of the buildings for which the controlled explosion will be carried out for the heavily damaged buildings.

## **Requirements**
- Complying with computer gear and program prerequisites for QGIS software installation and use.
- Gathering information on the topography, buildings, people density, roads, water supplies, and other geographical characteristics in the earthquake zone.
- Collecting data on earthquake-prone structures.
- Analyzing data from structures that were mildly injured, seriously damaged, collapsed, and collapsed.
